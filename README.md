# Learning_pthon_tic_tac_toe_game
Hey Everyone, 
This is Prajjwal Bhatt or you can call me BigB as well, This is my first major project of python in which I made an interesting game which allows two players to play tic toe game 
and test thier smartness. The working of this game is very simple in which the positions for the 'X' and 'O' corresponds to the Numbers as shown below.


   |   |                            7 | 8 | 9
---|---|---                        ---|---|---
   |   |       -------------->      4 | 5 | 6
---|---|---                        ---|---|---
   |   |                            1 | 2 | 3
   
   for placing a 'X' or 'O' at a particular position in the board you just need to enter the number corresponding to the position and a 'X' or 'O' will be placed there.
   
   and when someone wins the game then the program will tell you. 
   
   Just Remember that the player who will get the first turn will be decided by the program itself .
   
   For running this Program fluently Install Python 3.9.1 in your system and download the game file into your system with name tic_toe.py
   
   After downloading all the pre requisites you can run the program in the terminal. 
   
   Just Enjoy the game ! and let me know your Experience and also the updates that you want in the program.
